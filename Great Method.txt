Write a python function called AdjacentPair that takes one input list of integers called inList, which contains a minimum of 2 integers. Find the pair of adjacent integers in inList that has the largest product value and returns that product.

For example,
If the input list is [4, 1, 6, 8, 4, 3],
the adjacent items in the list with the largest product value is 6 & 8 and the value 48 is returned from the function

HINTs: Use a for loop with the range() function to iterate inList and the solution can be coded with just 9 lines of code.
